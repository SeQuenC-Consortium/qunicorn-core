Development Guidelines
======================

Contribution Process
----------------------
1. Issues are moved from the Product Backlog to the Sprint Backlog if:
    * The issue is well defined (Definition of Ready)
    * It is sprint planing
    * No other issues are in the sprint backlog and no other developer requires support.
2. The developer moves the issue to "In Progress" and starts working on it.
    * Developer assigns ticket to themself
3. Document important information during development within the issue
4. After completion of development (check DoD) issue is moved to "Ready for Review" and developer is unassigned
5. Pull Request: Before creating the pull request branch should be up to date with the master. Developer is assigned to PR.
6. After review by another developer, issue is moved to "Done". The reviewer unassigns themself.
    * In the case of feedback, notify developer and leave the feedback in the PR
7. Merge Pull Request
8. Supervisors review issue when they are in "Ready for Release"

Definition of Done
--------------------

* The code should be functional
* The code should have sufficient test coverage (depending on the implemented component)
* All "public" methods need a docstring
* Public endpoints need a tutorial/documentation on how to use them
* Linter and formatter have been run
* The DoD is checked by another developer, who was not involved in the creation
